# TexasTorque2021Delta

This repository serves as a rewrite of the 2021 codebase, originally created for practice. This code can be considered a superior verison of TexasTorque2021, and will be utilized at Texas Cup 2021.

This repository was also updated throughout the offseason. This remains the most superior codebase for Delta and Charlie. This should be used for official use over "TexasTorque2021OffSeasonDelta", an experimental off-season  rewrite.

## Branches

The branch names are a little confusing as the codebase was originally written with Charlie.

* *Master* = Charlie (Texas Cup)
* *Delta* = Delta (Texas Cup)
* *Delta++* = Delta (Driveteam practice)
  * teleop only
  * structure changes
  * control changes

Delta has some different motor controllers, design changes, and a new subsystem (WheelOfFortune). Code is not directly merged between Master and Delta, but rather copy-pasted between for items both robots share.
