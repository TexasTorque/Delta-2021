# TexasTorque2021Delta
This repository serves as a rewrite of the 2021 codebase, originally created for practice. This code can be considered a superior verison of TexasTorque2021, and will be utilized at Texas Cup 2021.

## Branches
The branch names are a little confusing as the codebase was originally written with Charlie.
* *Master* = Charlie
* *Delta* = Delta

Delta has some different motor controllers, design changes, and a new subsystem (WheelOfFortune). Code is not directly merged between Master and Delta, but rather copy-pasted between for items both robots share.
